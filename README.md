# Roblox Character Downloader Website

Welcome developers, congrats for your today first task woohoo!
Ok, lets go to the point. Make sure you followed this steps correctly for setup the website and run it to your own localhost:

1. Go to `/server` directory and run `npm install`. After that, go to `../client` and run `npm install` too.
2. Go to `/server` directory again, and make a copy of the `config.json.txt` also rename it to `config.json`. After that, you can edit the configuration fields (edit the port, edit the cors origin, edit the cdn directory position, etc).
3. After doing all the steps, you can run the server application and client application on dev mode with run `npm run dev` on both of the directory (server and client).
4. ...and now you're done! You can start view the frontend on `https://localhost:5173/` and for the backend on `https://localhost:3000/`.# rblxchar_backend
